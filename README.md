## Description
Animatrx is a MERN Stack SPA designed to help users discover new anime, as well as contribute to the conversation and right reviews for the anime they love (or hate!) the most. Comment on reviews and like/dislike reviews, comments, and replies. Does an anime you haven't seen have great reviews and an interesting plot description/art? Save it to your Watch Later list to access later. Is there an anime you loved so much you want to save it so you can watch it again later? Search the API for the anime and add it to your favorites. (Coming soon): Follow other users and see what shows they love, what they plan on watching, and what reviews they have posted. (Coming soon): Upload a profile picture (preferably of your anime alter ego)!
